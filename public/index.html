      <h2>Dear JavaScript disabled and text based browser users!</h2>
      <p>I know you were coming, so I made an old school text based site for you! :)</p>
      <h3>Quick about section</h3>
      <p>First of all my name is Kristóf Kékesi. I'm a math and CS major in a hungarian high school.</p>
      <h3>From the early days</h3>
      <p>
        I'm making software since 2017. In the early days I started making programs in Batch. The most complicated of them was a database management program.
        It made a lot of files since I haven't yet known any proper ways to make databases. Then as I needed more complex ways to solve the given problems I started using Python.
        For more visual programs I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had fun making personal programs and websites. In 2019 I decided to make something remarkable,
        something that the users could appreciate. I have entered to Mobile Development. Since then I'm more serious about code. For half a year I was learning Flutter and Dart.
        Eventually I made Elements, NASA Mira and Preacher. In 2020 I've registered kekesi.dev as my first ever domain. For it's first iteration I used the same tools as I used
        in my first projects. Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then one year later I decided to redesign and rewrite it in React. Here we are now.
      </p>
      <h3>As for the future</h3>
      <p>
        I'm planning to make Preacher and some other projects to be available to the userst of the web. For this I'm planning to use other technologies like Vue.js,
        Ruby on Rails and other new technologies and frameworks.
